waitress-example
================

An example URL shortener application to showcase what a Waitress application
may look like.


Getting Started
---------------

This assumes that you have your Go environment set up and $GOPATH configured.

Clone the project and build it:

$ git clone https://github.com/pnelson/waitress-example
$ cd waitress-example
$ go build
$ ./waitress-example

Create some shortcuts:

$ curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url":"http://pnelson.ca"}' http://localhost:3000/

You can create a bunch if you wish. Point your browser to short URL that has
been created and you will be redirected. Or you can stay in your terminal and
use curl again.

$ curl -v -X GET http://localhost:3000/b
